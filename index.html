          <p> Most of us know nothing more about coffee than how we like it to be brewed or served. We are so far removed from its reality 
              that we often forget that the coffee we buy either in bags or in trendy cups, is no more than a fraction of the whole story.  
              If you are curious about coffee, I welcome you to take this journey with me from past to present and travel the course of the 
              beans that give America it's daily high.
