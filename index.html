         <p> Most of us know nothing more than how we like to have our coffee served. We are so removed 
        from its reality that we ften forget that the coffee we buy either in bags or in trendy cups 
        from our favorite cafes is not the whole sotry. I welcome you to take this journey with me 
        from past to present to travel the course of the beans that gives America it's daily high.
