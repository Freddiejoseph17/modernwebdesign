      <h1>Coffee</h1>
      <h2>Legendary Accounts</h2>
      <p>According to legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to 
        recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant,[6] though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee 
        grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.[6] 
        The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after 
        eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[6]

      <p>Other accounts attribute the discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According to an ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir 
        manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert 
        cave near Ousab (modern day Wusab, about 90 km east of Zabid).[16] Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery, but found 
        them to be bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften 
        the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. 
        As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.[17] From Ethiopia, the coffee 
        plant was introduced into the Arab World through Egypt and Yemen.[18]

      <h2>Historical transmission</h2>
      <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the 
        accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way 
        to how it is now prepared. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.[19] Accounts differ on the 
        origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen. One account credits Muhammad ben Said for bringing the beverage to Aden 
        from the African coast.[20] Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to 
        Arabia.[21] According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions 
        in 1401. Famous 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings of a beverage called qahwa developed from a 
        tree in the Zeila region.[19]

      <p>By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee smuggled out 
        of the Middle East was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India in 1670. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise 
        sterilised. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants 
        grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore. Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and to
        the Americas.[22][better source needed]

      <p>In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East:
      </p>
      
      <p>A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, 
        quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit 
        from a bush called bunnu.

      <p>Cultivation was taken up by many countries in Central America in the latter half of the 19th century, and almost all involved the large-scale displacement and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions led to many uprisings, coups and bloody suppression of peasants.[39] The notable exception was Costa Rica, where lack of ready labor prevented the formation of large farms. Smaller farms and more egalitarian conditions ameliorated unrest over the 19th and 20th centuries.[40]

Rapid growth in coffee production in South America during the second half of the 19th century was matched by growth in consumption in developed countries, though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States, where high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita consumption between 1860 and 1920. Though the United States was not the heaviest coffee-drinking nation at the time (Nordic countries, Belgium, and Netherlands all had comparable or higher levels of per capita consumption), due to its sheer size, it was already the largest consumer of coffee in the world by 1860, and, by 1920, around half of all coffee produced worldwide was consumed in the US.[38]

Coffee has become a vital cash crop for many developing countries. Over one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee as their primary source of income. It has become the primary export and backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia,[41] as well as many Central American countries.
